## Scripts

### Random Password Generator (`Random_password_generator.py`)

This script generates a random password based on user-specified criteria, including:
- Length of the password
- Inclusion of uppercase letters
- Inclusion of special characters

The script ensures that the generated password meets the specified length and character type requirements.
